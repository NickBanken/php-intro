## 1. Difference between array, an associative array and an object
An **_Array_** is a set of same items each element can be refered with a single **index**.
However a **_Associative  array_** works with **key values** instead.

While **_arrays_** can only store data, **_Objects_** can do much more then that. They can store the data and also have functions to work with the data inside the object.
Something an **_array_** could never do.
